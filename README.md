# AttendanceLog

Could there be any easier way to take attendance at lectuers? Any method that is better than passing a paper around the class and have everyone sign it? People can sign for others that are not present! Have the first minute of the lecture displaying a QR code on the screen? People can take photos of that QR code and send it to others to register with it!

Can you cheat a system where you need to scan an NFC tag in an app that has your student ID? You could, but it's much more inconvenient, and we're looking for a way to make attendance taking as solid of a system as possible. Quick as well.

Students download the android app, input their university unique ID and scan the NFC tag at the entrance of the lecture theatre. The app sends the tag info as well as the ID to the lecturere's preffered attendance taking database. Convenient and fast to use.
